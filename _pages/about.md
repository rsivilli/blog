## Greetings!
Wether you are here searching for tips on sake home brewing, looking for a tutorial that helps piece some things together in the cloud, or just wandering the expanse that is the internet and just happen to stumble here, welcome! I hope you enjoy the stay and find something here interesting, useful or at least entertaining. 

## Who the heck is this guy?
My name is Robert Sivilli. 

The phrase "jack of all trades, master of none" certainly has a true ring to it. Being able to break down complex problems and develop and deploy solutions that cross multiple domains of experience and force me to learn new things and grow as a person is something that I'm passionate about and that I hope to share through this blog. 

By education, I have a Masters degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Central Florida. Looking back, my [thesis](https://stars.library.ucf.edu/etd/1253/) was really an excellent foreshadowing in how things would play out. Essentially, it was a hodgepodge of testbeds and software that I designed and implemented to enable other graduate students the ability to understand and document how their theory could be applied in application. I did everything from design of control systems, to embedded electronics, and vision-based processing. My only real problem with academia that kept me from pursuing a PhD was simply that a lot of research was for research sake or at least too early in the development lifecycle that I would ever see it deployed out to be used by people. Solving problems is fun, but there should be a point or purpose behind it. 

By career experience, I've had a rapid upwards trajectory working in the public sector for the Department of Defense over the last decade. Starting as a bench level engineer writing software for enabling satellites to operate autonomously, I rapidly moved through the ranks and grades to the part of being trusted to form and run a Program Management Office overseeing the prototyping and sustainment of multiple Space Force data systems. I prided myself on being one of the few within the civilian ranks that could lead from the front; building and contributing where I could on every project. This ensured that not only I knew the systems I managed intimately, it ensure that I was always at the top of my game when it game to defending design decisions against the many, many other organizations or groups that had an axe to grind. This position, however had me spending most of my time dealing with politics, defending budgets, and a collection of other things that were not solving problems and saving lives. 

In 2021, I was lucky enough to have been selected to be a part of a self described "SWAT team of nerds" that serve as rapid response team made up of top engineers, data scientists, product managers and designers -- from industry, government and the military -- working within the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Within this organization, I have found my happy place- I am back to designing and implementing solutions myself, I am making a significant difference solving immediate needs while getting out of my comfort zone to grow as a person with emerging technologies, and I am advising policy to impact change for the better when it comes to how the DoD does software. 

By hobby, when I'm not working, I have a couple of vices. Over the last year, I've gotten into brewing sake and am quite proud of how things have turned out with my brews. I've been known to enjoy the occasional cigar, a nice peaty scotch, and a good science fiction or fantasy novel. I also delve into a bit of amateur game development with Unity. 

## Why are you creating a blog?
A few reasons, actually. 

First and foremost, This blog serves to document a collection of experiences and tribal knowledge, as well as explorations into new tools and technologies, in an attempt to pay back years of success and accomplishment that in no small part can be attributed by people that have created similar blogs. I think being able to stand on the shoulders of those that came before and benefit from what they have learned is an important part of success and I'm definitely at a point in my life where I should be contributing back to that community.

If this blog saves even one person the hassle of digging through years of stackoverflow posts or bootstraps them up to working on an actual new problem instead of struggling with just getting started, it will have served its purpose.

Secondly, to help create a portfolio of sorts. Working in public sector, especially the DoD, does not provide a lot of opportunities to contribute to open source projects and the global knowledge base. As I am in a position that counters that norm, I am trying to set an example for others that follow. 

Lastly, I was curious about some of the frameworks that were out there and this served as a good project to learn a bit more about them. 

## Any interesting topics coming up?
While this will definitely be a work in progress, the following should be on the radar:
- Creating and hosting your own blog (I know, kind of cheating but this was me trying something new)
- Sake brewing basics
- Bootstrapping an AWS environment with terraform and basic lock-downs
- Terraform-based implementation of central monitoring 
- Worker paradigm for lambda-based parallel processing
